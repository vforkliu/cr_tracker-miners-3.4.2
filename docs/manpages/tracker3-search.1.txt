==================

== NAME

tracker3-search - Search for content by type or across all types

== SYNOPSIS

*tracker3 search* [_options_...] [[_expression1_] ...]

== DESCRIPTION

*tracker3 search* searches all indexed content for _expression_. The
resource in which _expression_ matches must exist (see *--all* for more
information). All results are returned in ascending order. In all cases,
if no _expression_ is given for an argument (like *--folders* for
example) then ALL items in that category are returned instead.

_expression_::
  One or more terms to search. The default operation is a logical AND.
  For logical OR operations, see -r.

*-e, --emails*::

  subjects for emails found.
*-c, --contacts*::
  Search for contacts matching _expression_ (optional). Returns a list
  of names and email addresses found.
*--software*::
  Search for software installed matching _expression_ (optional).
  Returns a list of desktop files and application titles found.
*--software-categories*::
  Search for software categories matching _expression_ (optional).
  Returns a list of urns and their categories (e.g. Settings, Video,
  Utility, etc).
*--feeds*::
  Search through RSS feed information matching _expression_ (optional).
  Returns a list of those found.
*-b, --bookmarks*::
  Search through bookmarks matching _expression_ (optional). Returns a
  list titles and links for each bookmark found.
*-l, --limit=<__limit__>*::
  Limit search to _limit_ results. The default is 10 or 512 with
  --disable-snippets.
*-o, --offset=<__offset__>*::
  Offset the search results by _offset_. For example, start at item
  number 10 in the results. The default is 0.
*-r, --or-operator*::
  Use OR for search terms instead of AND (the default)
*-d, --detailed*::
  Show the unique URN associated with each search result. This does not
  apply to --music-albums and --music-artists.
*-a, --all*::
  Show results which might not be available. This might bebecause a
  removable media is not mounted for example. Without this option,
  resources are only shown if they exist. This option applies to all
  command line switches except
*--disable-snippets*::
  Results are shown with snippets. Snippets are context around the word
  that was searched for in the first place. This gives some idea of if
  the resource found is the right one. Snippets require Full Text Search
  to be compile time enabled AND to not be disabled with --disable-fts.
  Using --disable-snippets only shows the resources which matched, no
  context is provided about where the match occurred.
*--disable-fts*::
  If Full Text Search (FTS) is available, this option allows it to be
  disabled for one off searches. This returns results slightly using
  particular properties to match the search terms (like "nie:title")
  instead of looking for the search terms amongst ALL properties. It is
  more limiting to do this, but sometimes searching without FTS can
  yield better results if the FTS ranking is off.
*--disable-color*::
  This disables any ANSI color use on the command line. By default this
  is enabled to make it easier to see results.
