==================

== NAME

tracker3-status - Provide status and statistics on the data indexed

== SYNOPSIS

....
tracker3 status
tracker3 status [[expression1]...]
tracker3 status --stat [-a] [[expression1]...]
....

== DESCRIPTION

Display the status of the current index and data set. A summary of
recorded failures during file metadata indexing is also displayed.

Providing a search expression will list the full details of the
recorded failures matching the filename.

With the *--stat* option, displays statistics about the RDF classes and
how many of each exist for data set that has been indexed. For example,
"10 Folders".

== OPTIONS

*--stat[=__expression__]*::
  By default, only common and useful classes are shown, e.g.
  "nfo:Document" or "nfo:Folder", for a full set of statistics, see the
  *--all* option.

If one or more _expression_ arguments is given, the statistics returned
are filtered to only show information those RDF types matching
_expression_ (case folded and matching accented variants). The RDF
classes are detailed by the Nepomuk otology specification. A list of
possible classes matching _expression_, see *tracker3 sparql -c*.

*-a, --all*::
  Display statistics about ALL RDF classes that exist in the database.
  Without this option only the common RDF classes will be shown, for
  example "nfo:Document" and "nfo:FileDataObject".

This option is implied if search terms are provided to filter ALL
possible statistics.
