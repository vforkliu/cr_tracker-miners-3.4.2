=================

== NAME

tracker3-reset - Reset the index and configuration

== SYNOPSIS

*tracker3 reset* [--filesystem | --rss] [--file _FILE_]

== DESCRIPTION

The reset command will change either your configuration or index
irreversibly and should be used with care. Other than tags, actual data
(e.g. files) should not be affected by this command.

The "index" is a link between your content (either locally or remotely)
and how it can be found quickly using a number of different queries.
Under the hood, this is done using a database.

Removing all data and starting again from the beginning with an empty
data set (which is a common use of this command) is done by using the
hard reset option. This behaves as if Tracker was just installed.

== OPTIONS

*-s, --filesystem*::
  Removes data stored by tracker-miner-fs(1). The miner will automatically
  recreate its cache from the filesystem when it restarts.
*-r, --rss*::
  Removes data stored by tracker-miner-rss(1).
*-f, --file _FILE_*::
  Resets all indexed information about _FILE_, works recursively for
  directories. Nothing will be done if _FILE_ is not currently indexed.
  After deletion, a request to reindex this data will be immediately
  issued.
