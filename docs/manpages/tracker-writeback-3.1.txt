tracker-writeback-3(1)
======================

== NAME

tracker-writeback-3 - Used to write metadata set in Tracker back to
physical files.

== SYNOPSIS

*tracker-writeback* [_OPTION_...]

== DESCRIPTION

*tracker-writeback* is not supposed to be run by the user since it is
started by its .desktop file when the user logs in. It can also be
started manually of course for debugging purposes. You can not run more
than one instance of this at the same time.

*tracker-writeback* writes metadata from the Tracker database back into
files only. Currently support is limited to XMP metadata (which covers
PNG, JPEG, TIFF, MP4 and 3GPP formats), play lists (which covers
MPEGURL, SCPLS and IRIVER formats) and taglib supported mime types
(which covers MP3, MP4, OGG, WAV, FLAC and some Windows media formats).

Data is only written back if write-back is enabled in the
tracker-miner-fs configuration.
