===============

== NAME

tracker3-tag - Add, remove and list tags.

== SYNOPSIS

....
tracker3 tag FILE1 [FILE2 ...] [-l <limit>] [-o <offset>] [-r]
tracker3 tag -t [[TAG1] [TAG2] ...] [-s] [-r]
tracker3 tag -a <TAG> [-e <description>] 
tracker3 tag -d <TAG>
....

== DESCRIPTION

List tags for local files or by the tag labels themselves if -t is used.

It's also possible to manage tags with the -a and and -d options.

The _FILE_ argument can be either a local path or a URI. It also does
not have to be an absolute path.

== OPTIONS

*-t, --list*::
  List all tags. Results include the number of files associated with
  that tag and the tag's unique identifier. You can show the files
  associated with each tag by using --show-files.

The _TAG_ arguments are optional. If no _TAG_ argument is specified, all
tags are listed. If one or more __TAG__s are given, either matching tags
are listed (OR condition). For example, this will match any tags named
either _foo_, _bar_ or _baz_:

....
$ tracker3-tag -t foo bar baz
....

*-s, --show-files*::
  Show the files associated with each tag. This option is ONLY available
  WITH the *--list* option.
*-a, --add=TAG*::
  Add a tag with the name _TAG_. If no _FILE_ arguments are specified,
  the tag is simply created (if it didn'talready exist) and no files are
  associated with it. Multiple _FILE_ arguments can be specified.
*-d, --delete=TAG*::
  Delete a tag with the name _TAG_. If no _FILE_ arguments are
  specified, the tag is deleted for ALL files. If _FILE_ arguments are
  specified, only those files have the _TAG_ deleted.
*-e, --description=STRING*::
  This option ONLY applies when using *--add* and provides a description
  to go with the tag label according to _STRING_.
*-l, --limit=N*::
  Limit search to N results. The default is 512.
*-o, --offset=N*::
  Offset the search results by N. For example, start at item number 10
  in the results. The default is 0.
*-r, --and-operator*::
  Use AND operator for search terms instead of OR (the default). For
  example:

....
$ tracker3-tag -s -t sliff sloff
....

Should show files in the database that have both the _sliff_ and _sloff_
tags.
