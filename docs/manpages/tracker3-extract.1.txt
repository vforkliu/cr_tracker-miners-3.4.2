tracker3-extract(1)
===================

== NAME

tracker3-extract - Extract metadata from a file.

== SYNOPSYS

*tracker3 extract* _FILE_

== DESCRIPTION

*tracker3 extract* reads the file provided and extracts any metadata it
can from this file, then displays the metadata on standard output.

The metadata is displayed as a SPARQL update command, that can be run
against a SPARQL endpoint to update its copy of the metadata.

The actual extraction is done by a separate process. This is done to
isolate the calling process from any memory leaks or crashes in the
libraries Tracker uses to extract metadata.

For more information see the libtracker-extract reference documentation.

== OPTIONS

*-o, --output-format=<__FORMAT__>*::
  Choose which format to use to output results. Supported formats are
  _sparql_, _turtle_ and _json-ld_.

== EXAMPLES

Using command line to extract metadata from a file:::

$ tracker3 extract /path/to/some/file.mp3

== ENVIRONMENT

*G_MESSAGES_DEBUG*::
  Controls verbose log output from GLib-based code. Use
  `G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=Tracker` to see only Tracker-related
  logs, or `G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all` to see everything.
*TRACKER_DEBUG*::
  Enables more specialized debug output. Pass a comma-separated
  list of one or more keywords:
    config::: extractor configuration
    statistics::: show statistics about how many files were processed
    status:: log the status messages that are published over D-Bus
